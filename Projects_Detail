Here you will find 4 projects on python language and Machine Learning:
1) MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION 
Task : Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of amovie based on its plot summary or other textual information. 
Youcan use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifierssuch as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support VectorMachines.
2) CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
Task : Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. 
Use adataset containing information about credit card transactions, andexperiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,or 
Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent orlegitimate.
3) CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
Task : Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. 
Use historical customer data, includingfeatures like usage behavior and customer demographics,
and tryalgorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or GradientBoosting to predict churn.
4) SPAM SMS DETECTION 
Task : Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam orlegitimate. 
Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings withclassifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support VectorMachines to identify spam messages.
